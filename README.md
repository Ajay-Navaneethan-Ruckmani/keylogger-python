# keylogger-python

This is a simple keylogger which was coded in python. When the program runs it creates a log file in the desktop. You can change it by changing the loggin-directory

To make the program run in background without getting a popup of cmd, use pythonw

Using pythonw
Just change the file extension of your python script from .py to .pyw and thatâ€™s it! Now, just double click the newly named .pyw file and it will run in the background.

To kill,
in windows, use 
~tasklist
~taskkill /PID <pid> pythonw.exe /F
